# OS Experiments

My having fun making a 32-bit (for now) kernel and maybe some other stuff to go with it.

## Features
 * [x] Boot
 * [x] Screen output
 * [x] Keyboard input
 * [-] printf and other clib (a bit)
 * [x] Paging
 * [x] Dynamic memory
 * [ ] Virtual file system
 * [ ] multiprocessing
 * [ ] user mode

## Build Requirements

 * nasm
 * gcc toolchain for elf32

## Building on linux

Just run `make -s`. If you have qemu, you can run the script `qemu.sh` which will build the repo and start it with
qemu in curses mode.

## Debugging

Run `qemu.sh -s -S` in one terminal and `gdb.sh` in the other
